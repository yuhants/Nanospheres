This is a set of scripts for carrying out common procedures on the experiment.

Charge Measurement - This script sends a pulse to trigger the HV supply connected to the needle whilst simultaneously driving the nanosphere with a sinusoidal drive. It also records the data with the picoscope and performs an analysis of the amplitude of the sinusoidal peak in the PSD.
